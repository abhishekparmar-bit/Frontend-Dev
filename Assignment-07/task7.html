  <h1>Typography and Text Styling Showcase</h1>

    <p>
      <mark>Typography</mark> plays a crucial role in design and readability. The right choice of 
      <strong>font family</strong>, weight, and size can completely change how your 
      <em>content feels</em> to the reader.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every design benefits from clear hierarchy, spacing, and alignment. A well-balanced 
      <strong>line-height</strong> and <em>letter-spacing</em> make the text easy to scan and enjoy.
    </p>

    <p>
      Whether you’re designing for the web or print, keep in mind that 
      <mark>readability</mark> is always more important than decoration.
